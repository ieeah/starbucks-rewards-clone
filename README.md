# Starbucks Rewards Page Clone

## Intro

I'm a newbie/still-studying developer and I need some practice to do, aside of the bootcamp i'm already participating in, so...

Since I'm having some new year's holidays i thought to keep practicing with web development cloning [this beautiful page](https://www.starbucks.com/rewards "the original starbuck's page") from the Starbuck's website.<br>

I tried being as accurate as possible, and I think it's kind of a good result, even if it differs a bit in some containers width and some animations.<br>
*and probably something more*.

## Actual State

I decided to put this page on Github just when I finished it for having it as a reference for me in the times to come, and maybe collecting some tips.

### Responsiveness

It's not responsive at this moment but I'll probably try to make it responsive in the next few days.

### Code and CSS "cleanliness"

I'm always been a "code cleanliness" supporter, but probably in this codebase I haven't been that clean, that's why I'm trying to use new features as SCSS (whit is mixins ecc ecc) so I'm kind of exploring many ways of doing things.

PS: I'm not a big fan of css-utility-class, because it's definitely true that keep the css code clean, but it's also true that dirties the html code; And also logically, i think it's better to have one unique place where finding the css of an element, instead of going around trough different sections of different scss files.

## ToDo List

Some things that I'd like to improve / implement

- Responsiveness (as already told)
- improving the accuracy of sizes related to the original page
- cleaning the code and refactoring where it's possible, reducing code repetitions.
- **fixing the insert-code animation when the input:text get/lose the focus** *(any suggestion about this would really be appreciated)*.

# Starbucks Rewards Page Clone

## Intro

I'm a newbie/still-studying developer and I need some practice to do, aside of the bootcamp i'm already participating in, so...

Since I had some new year's holidays i thought to keep practicing cloning [this beautiful page](https://www.starbucks.com/rewards "the original starbuck's page") from the Starbuck's website.<br>

I tried being as accurate as possible, and I think it's kind of a good result, even if it differs a bit in some containers width and some animations.<br>
*and probably something more*.

```
NOTICE: I deliberately decided not to use any framework for css (not even for responsiveness) to increase the challenge and to practice with an "harder css" (and media queries).
However, I opted for the use of scss, because it's okay to want to challenge yourself
but we must not exaggerate haha
```

## Actual State

I decided to put this page on Github to have a reference for me in the times to come, and maybe collecting some tips.

#### Responsiveness

After not a few problems, I've done the responsiveness of this page and I have to admit that I'm pretty happy of the result.
(** in some wrapper sizes or other detail here and there my version differs a lot from the original. But I did it on purpose due to my aesthetic sense, I mean, this is not for a real job**)

#### Code and CSS "cleanliness"

I do like to try coding clean.
But this time I did a mess LOL.
I tried some new stuff, I haven't used any utility-class (that's on purpose) and I haven't focused that much as I usually try to do.
Forgive me.

## ToDo List

Some things that I'd like to improve / implement and I have some clue on how doing it.
(this are not urgent, and I'll fix them if / when I'll have some spare time)

- improving the accuracy of sizes related to the original page.
- cleaning the code and refactoring where it's possible, reducing code repetitions.
- I had to put some fixed heights for every single accordeon-FAQ-section (on mobile) to make it transition from 0 to is height, and not make it just suddenly switch from o to 100%.


### Known issues

###### Things that I know aren't working properly but I have no idea why or what to do

- I Haven't been able to make the mobile navigation close automatically when the size of the screen is bigger than 780px *(any suggestion about this would really be appreciated)*.

##### My name is Francesco, I'm from Italy and as you can clearly see, I'm a noob!
